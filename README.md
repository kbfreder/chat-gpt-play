Based on freeCodeCamp.org's tutorial: https://youtu.be/uRQH2CFvedY

Build several projects based on / using OpenAI's API for "ChatGPT" (text completion or chat-bot-trained large-language models)

Note what they call projects and what I've named my subfolders here don't align.

- project 01: text completion
    - basic javascript + simple HTML
    - `curl` command
- project 02: chat completions
    - basic javascript + simple HTML
    - `curl` command

- project 03: Chat Completion Project 1
    - JavaScript + HTML + CSS app
        - no backend, so must redact API key

- project 04: Chat Completion Project 2
    - React + Node.js
    - includes backend
